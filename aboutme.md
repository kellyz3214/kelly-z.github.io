subtitle: A little bit about my interests
---

As an undergraduate rising junior at Yale University, I devote my studies to Computing and the Arts, with an emphasis on graphic design. I plan on focusing on using design and software to smooth out user interfaces and optimize user experiences for the better, with a focus on improving readability for disabled audiences.

### I am currently seeking

I am currently seeking a 2020 fall internship in UI/UX design. My work as a software developer intern for Maven (a language-learning startup) and a graphic designer for the Yale Center for International and Professional Experience complemented my academic coursework in computer science and the arts and allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of substantive artistic and computing problems. I am excited to apply my strengths in computer science and visual arts to real-world problems in the industry.
